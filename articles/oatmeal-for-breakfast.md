There's a lot of information on the internet about the _best and healthiest_ breakfast solutions. They all propose something different and claim to be a breakthrough, but do we really need to have the latest "slimming" breakfasts trends, and do they even work? There is one thing that we all know does work. . . _consistency_. If we eat something consistently at the same time of day, that is enough to kick-start us into motion. However, we can do better than just eating something, so let’s optimize. What should you be eating then? The answer: Oatmeal. The following are reasons why **having oatmeal for breakfast is the best way to start and maintain a healthy daily routine**.

## Caloric Information

For your average 140lb - 210lb (60kg - 95kg) person, breakfast starts with **1 cup of oats**. If your weight is outside that, scale your intake depending on your weight gain/loss goals. The type of oat matters a lot as _1 cup of steel-cut oats contains 600 calories with 108g of carbs and 20g of protein_ whereas _1 cup of rolled oats contains 300 calories with 54g of carbs and 10g of protein_ (half as much).

Obviously oatmeal by itself is not the best-tasting breakfast, but if you add a slight bit of something _sweet_, it completely changes the game. We already have enough carbs coming from the oatmeal itself so adding anything with sugar would be a waste of calories, so the solution is to **add 0.25 - 1 scoop of your favorite protein powder**. This amplifies the protein content of your breakfast and takes the flavor to a whole new level. By adding a half scoop of your average protein powder _(25g protein and 120 calories per scoop)_, you increase the nutrition content of your oatmeal to 54g of carbs and 22g of protein with a total of 360 calories.

## Choosing the Type of Oat

The best oat for you will vary depending on your preferences for _texture_. I suggest avoiding steel-cut and Scottish oats and opting for either old-fashioned / **rolled oats, instant oats, or quick oats** as the former take longer to cook and don’t give the classic oatmeal experience. This is where texture preferences come into play as old-fashioned and rolled oats will have a slight chew/crunch after cooking whereas the instant oats and the even thinner quick oats result in a much creamier porridge.

## Cooking

The best way to cook the oatmeal is either on a stovetop or in a microwave. Both can produce a result equal in taste and consistency with the only difference being that the **microwave is significantly faster**.

#### Microwave (3 mins)

1. Pour 1 cup of oats into a microwave-safe bowl
2. Fill the bowl with just enough water to submerge all the oats
3. Place the bowl in the microwave and cook for 2 minutes
4. Pour half scoop of protein powder onto cooked oatmeal
5. Stir thoroughly and add water if the consistency is too thick and continue to stir if the consistency is too thin

#### Stovetop (8-10 mins)

1. Combine 1 cup oats and 2 cups water in a pot over low-medium heat
2. Bring to simmer, stirring frequently
3. Once the oats begin to soften and the liquid thickens, you can add your protein powder
4. Simmer and stir until the oats reach your desired texture and consistency

## Energy for the Day

I find that the energy obtained from the carbs combined with my morning coffee is a great way to get the engines started for the day.

If you are someone who likes to work out in the morning, you’ll find yourself ready to _train within 30 minutes_ after finishing. With the whole grain carbs, you will find _lasting energy through your workout_ without feeling weighed down by your stomach. The protein powder provides adequate protein nourishment throughout your workout to ensure that your body has the building blocks to _grow new muscle within your metabolic window_.

If no physical activity is done after eating, the oatmeal has 4 grams of fiber to keep you full until lunchtime, so _if your goal is to lose weight, this is for you too_.

### Continue your day

When training, I like to have eggs after having worked out in the morning. Here are some of my other articles on the different ways to implement eggs into your diet:\
