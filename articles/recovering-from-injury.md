## Being faced with injury

If you’re like me, adventure drives our adrenaline, and pushing ourselves to do more is what makes us better. In adventure, however, there is an inherent risk…injury. To put it bluntly, injuries suck. Whether you’ve broken your toe or fractured a limb, there are going to be some limitations on what you can and cannot do with your body.

It is important to remember that injuries are only temporary setbacks. Even if you may never be able to do a particular exercise again, there are always other things you can do to maintain your health.

## Maintaining mental fortitude

The toughest part about getting injured, aside from the pain, is the mental state that it puts you in. Some injuries are worse than others and some disable you for longer than others, but regardless of the situation, it is essential to maintain a positive growth mindset.

Be honest with yourself, acknowledge that this may be putting a lot of stress on you, and forgive yourself for getting into whatever situation caused you to be in this position. There is no reason to wallow in the muck for longer than you should. Instead, have faith that your body is going to get better and be proactive about strengthing your mind. I have an [article](/article/mindful-lifting) about how mindfulness can have a positive impact on mental and physical growth if that is something you’re interested in.

## Resting an injury

This is another one of those things that depends a lot on the type of injury sustained. Some injuries require just a few days of rest while others can take weeks, or even months before they’re ready to see action again. Not allowing your injury the proper rest can cause long-term damage so it is important to talk to your doctor or at least do some research on your own to get an idea about the amount of recovery time you should be expecting.

Resting is simple, avoid all physical exertion on and around the injury. For example, if you have a shoulder injury, rest your entire arm, if you have a knee injury, rest your whole leg. Remember, you’re going to end up recovering faster and stronger if you give yourself ample time to let the body process the damage. Using the injured part too soon can cause the healing process to be extended and can lead to unnecessary tissue being created around the injury.
Note that while rest is important initially after an injury, lying in bed for too long can delay recovery. It’s best to only rest for 24 hours. If you can, make sure you get out of bed, even if only for a few minutes every hour. There is definitely a balance when it comes to rest as becoming active sooner can reduce a delay in recovery just as much as rest.

## Gradually introducing resistance

After allowing your body the necessary rest period, it’s time to start moving again. Motion is essential for getting you back up to speed as soon as possible. One of the best ways to prevent worsening an injury is to listen to the warning signs the body gives out. The common expression “no pain, no gain” has created the misconception that pain equates to growth. In reality, pain is the body’s way of telling you something is not right!

Feel free to experiment with new exercises that focus on the injury. Keep things very light for the first few days or weeks by using rubber stretching bands, light dumbbells, bodyweight, or even just stretching. Regardless of which method of strengthening you choose to go with, be sure to listen to your body. Knowing your limits is the key to recovering in a timely manner. There is nothing to be gained from trying to expedite the recovery process by pushing yourself beyond your limits.
